# Ingest-Ruby
The precursor to the rails-based Ingest tool.
It does not have a UI, and is only concerned with populating Neo4j.
Grew out of this mainly to bring in file handling and to be able to start building a UI.

Note: I say this does not have a UI, but there are a couple of seeds of a UI that I left in; a console app that works like a text-based adventure game, and an html viewer for a couple of the models.
